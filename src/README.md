## Install
```sh
yarn global add mbakex
```


Note: we use a native sqlite, and it has a downstream dependency to python v2.7 during install/build time
Note: currently node needs to be install via nvm (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
Note: if changed node version you may need to do this first:  `sudo yarn global remove mbakex`
