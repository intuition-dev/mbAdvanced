## Install

```sh
    yarn global add node-gyp@latest 
    yarn global add mbakex
```

    You can use npm instead of yarn anytime.


Note: we use a native sqlite driver. It needs gyp, or python v2.7 during install
Note: currently node needs to be install via nvm (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
Note: if changed node version you may need to do this first:  `sudo yarn global remove mbakex`
