## Install

```sh
    yarn global add node-gyp@latest 
    yarn global add mbakex
```

    You can use npm instead of yarn anytime.


Note: We use a native sqlite driver. It needs `yarn global add node-gyp@latest`, or python v2.7 during install

Notes: 
- It is best to install node via via nvm (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- If node version changed, you may need to do this first:  `yarn global remove mbakex`
- I use yarn > v2.x, but npm should work
