Relative performance of Webpack, vs/ modern lazy loading w/JAMstack approach; and future of 'import'

I wrote an article on the above topic in github, here is the link
https://github.com/intuition-dev/mbakeAdvanced/tree/master/lazyLoading

In the article I compare performance of Webpack vs modern lazy loading w/JAMstack approach.
And I touch future of 'import' and show an advanced example of lazy loading. Plus I give tips on how to optimize performance.
