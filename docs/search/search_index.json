META has a watcher that triggers 'mbake' when you save a file. How to run an mbake app (such as Hello World) mbake apps run on any static web server. This includes low-cost cloud hosting such as Amazon S3. We show how to work with S3 later in this doc. When you develop locally, you could use 'Web Server for Chrome' to run mbake apps. To install it, open your Google Chrome web browser and install the 'Web Server for Chrome' app from here . Launch the app, click the 'Choose Folder' button and select the root folder of your app (e.g. where index.html of your Hello World app is). Also ensure 'Options' has 'Automatically show index.html' checked. Ensure the Web Server is STARTED, then navigate to the proposed URL (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8887). Even though mbake apps are installed on a static server, they are dynamic because they allow user authentication and work with JSON for dynamic rendering and database APIs for dynamic databinding. How to generate a sample app with mbake ## Run mbake help to see the list of current sample apps mbake ## Generate sample app, e.g. mbake -v ## Navigate to it, e.g. cd crud Other popular mbake commands mbake -c . - Convert Pug/Riot files to useable comp/js, e.g.: data binding. mbake -i . - Convert dat.yaml static files to JSON, for dynamic binding.

With MetaBake's modern development approach, it is not about replacing your tech stack with another tech stack -- it is about eliminating it! About MetaBake mBake.org is a development productivity suite. It should allow you to deliver 10 times faster then legacy development stacks/methodologies. We have found that - with mBake.org; - the work of 6 developers over 6 months can be done by 3 developers in 3 weeks. We expect you to achieve the same productivity gains. How does open source MetaBake deliver 10X faster and cheaper web app development? Not enough organizations are fully leveraging the new Serverless. With Serverless services like Firestore and S3 you get rid of ALL server-side and middleware development and operations. This is where up to 2/3 of your time and cost used to go. Gone! On the client side (browser apps and mobile apps) MetaBake does something similar: it eliminates much of the tech stack and reduces the amount of coding and complexity. How? In school textbooks you learned about 1st generation languages, 2nd generation languages and our current 3rd generation languages, such as JavaScript, PHP and Ruby. With each new generation we achieved huge productivity improvements. We consider 'Pug'--also used by Node/Express--a 4th generation language that helps gain an equally big jump in productivity. With MetaBake we show you how to build complete applications in Pug. With this low-code approach we demonstrate much faster and cheaper web app and mobile app development. The MetaBake approach has 10 pillars that are the foundation for achieving mind-blowing development productivity gains. I'll just mention one more pillar here: automatic programming. You've probably heard of 'static site generators' like Hugo or Jekyll that people use to generate their web site or a blog. Automatic programming means using a similar generator to write your web app! This can get you to yet another level of productivity. To learn more about the MetaBake approach, including all 10 pillars and full examples, go to mBake.org. Or, to dive in right away, use the 'mbake CLI' from github.com/MetaBake as the first step into 10X faster web app development. mBake.org productivity is based on three modules: mbake, a static site generation tool that runs locally B-M-SPA, curated technologies and techniques that help you build dynamic apps and mobile apps faster Meta, a bespoke cloud-based build and admin app infrastructure that helps deliver functionality to your clients more quickly We benchmark against LAMP , RAILS , MEAN and such For example, LAMP is the technology WordPress was built on. Every 10 years or so technology gets 10 times better, which forces everyone to upgrade. Assembly was 10 times better than machine language. C/.js is 10 times better than Assembly. We believe that we found the answer on how to have a more productive team. So far, somehow, server-side rendered LAMP has dominated web deployments, with WordPress having some 30% of the World Wide Web. It is time to start displacing that. You can reinvest the time saved by using MetaBake into a more interactive user experience (UX). Better UX is proven to lead into higher user engagement and better user retention. About mbake mbake leverages the clarity, simplicity and productivity gained by using the declarative markup language Pug . We think of Pug as 4GL. mbake currently compiles Pug, Markdown and Yaml to generate HTML and JSON. Using the power of JavaScript, more transformers can be added. mbake runs as a small node process, either on your machine or in the cloud. mbake generates static sites, but it also supports making those sites dynamic with API calls and data feeds such as from JSON. mbake helps is another example of a http://staticgen.com webapp. mbake includes sample starters apps for CRUD. After you are comfortable with mbake, check out B-M-SPA and Meta. Prerequisites: you should know HTML and CSS. If you need to catch up, we recommend 'Design and Build Websites' by Jon Duckett. You will also learn Pug, to get started on Pug, watch Pug on Youtube Best way to get started with mbake is to read the Docs, linked at he top of the page.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#low-code-10x-faster-web-app-development","text":"","title":"low-code = 10X faster web app development."},{"location":"about/#with-metabakes-modern-development-approach-it-is-not-about-replacing-your-tech-stack-with-another-tech-stack-it-is-about-eliminating-it","text":"","title":"With MetaBake's modern development approach, it is not about replacing your tech stack with another tech stack -- it is about eliminating it!"},{"location":"about/#about-metabake","text":"mBake.org is a development productivity suite.

Including social media metadata in all new pieces of content allows you to optimize for sharing Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and Pinerest by defining exactly how titles, descriptions, images and more appear in social streams. The implications for SEO are also significant. The right data, including optimized images, helps content to spread, which often leads to increased links and mentions. You can find many templates of SEO meta tags in the internet (eg: here ) In mbake you can write values for each meta tag and for each page in the page's dat.yaml file and then in the layout address to these fields in meta tags. This allows you to define meta tags just once (in the layout) amd then access to them on each page from dat.yaml file. You can inspect code in the example blog app: $ mbake -b in the /layout/layout.pug file you can see defined SEO meta tags in head : meta(name='description', content=content_text) //- Schema.org markup for Google+ meta(itemprop='name', content=title) meta(itemprop='description', content=content_text) meta(itemprop='image', content=image) //- Twitter Card data meta(name='twitter:title', content=title) meta(name='twitter:description', content=content_text) meta(name='twitter:image', content=image) //- Open Graph data meta(property='og:title', content=title) meta(property='og:image', content=image) meta(property='og:description', content=comment) Notice that instead of their value (text or url) there are variables.
