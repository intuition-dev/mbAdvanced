# Design

Design of UI is very important because it is the first thing that customer see on project (before the functionallity and code), so UI should be nice, at least neat, match colors, fonts, and shape of main controls and blocks on site. We use Spectre scss framework as default design UI, so you need to know Spectre well, which blocks and visual functionallity is has, to look when you'll get a task to do some block on real project. Also the UI should be responsive, Spectre has a section in the docs dedicated to the responsive layout.

For more information on Spectre SCSS framework see [Spectre docs](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/getting-started.html)
